# network-intrusion-detection-ml
This project implements a machine learning–based Network Intrusion Detection System using the NSL-KDD dataset. Random Forest, SVM, and a Deep Neural Network are trained and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC to identify malicious network traffic effectively.
